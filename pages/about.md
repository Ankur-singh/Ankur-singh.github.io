# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}**,

Currently pursuing a Master's in Software Engineering at SJSU, expecting to graduate in May 2024. Concurrently, I work part-time at Intel as an AI Solutions Engineer. Prior to joining Intel in May 2023, I spent a year as a research assistant under Dr. Wu and Dr. Liu at SJSU Research Foundation, focusing on Federated Learning, Traffic Flow Prediction, and edge deployment.

With 4 years of prior professional experience in AI/ML, Software Engineering, DevOps, Cloud, and Databases, I embarked on my journey by founding [AI Adventures](https://www.aiadventures.in/){:target="_blank"}, a startup providing AI/ML solutions. Later, as an ML Team Lead at [Zoop.One](https://zoop.one/){:target="_blank"}, I orchestrated the successful launch of four ML services, housing 20+ deep learning models, handling over 2M+ requests/month. All this in just ten months. My approach, grounded in first principles, emphasized improving developer experience through process building, establishing best practices, and setting up efficient ML infrastructure, leading to rapid prototyping and significantly reduced Time To Market (TTM). I'm really proud of my work at Zoop.

Beyond my professional endeavors, I am an avid reader and actively participate in competitions, winning multiple Kaggle competitions and hackathons. I've contributed to several open-source projects and created two Python packages: colab-everything and torchserve-python, aiming to give back to the community. I aspire to give a talk at a Python Conference someday.
