# **About Me**

Hi, I am **{{ site.author.name }}**,

I’m an AI Solutions Engineer at **Intel**, where I optimize cutting-edge AI workloads for Intel hardware. This deep dive into system-level performance tuning has sparked a passion for **performance engineering in GenAI** and **distributed training**, leading me to explore tools like `Triton`, `torch.compile`, `Torch Distributed`, and `FSDP`. I actively document my learnings in my [Today I Learned (TIL)](https://ankursinghmle.notion.site/c9ec2730e014406187628b59a15aadb3?v=191eb3f27860427688085d92960d4cf5) knowledge base.

I earned my **Master’s in Software Engineering from San Jose State University** in May 2024, where I worked as a research assistant under Dr. Wu and Dr. Liu at the SJSU Research Foundation. My research spanned **Multi-Modal Learning**, **Federated Learning**, **Traffic Flow Prediction**, and **real-time edge deployment**—giving me hands-on exposure to applied ML in highly constrained environments.

My journey into AI started earlier right after my undergrad. I founded **[AI Adventures](https://www.aiadventures.in/)**—a startup delivering tailored AI/ML solutions. Later, at **[Zoop.One](https://zoop.one/)**, I built a lean ML team that developed and deployed **four production ML services**, housing **20+ deep learning models** and processing over **2 million requests/month**—all within just **10 months**. I focused on building robust ML infrastructure, optimizing developer workflows, and shortening the path from idea to production. These principles—**first-principles thinking, system design, and rapid iteration**—remain at the core of my work.

I thrive at the intersection of research and production, constantly shipping, breaking, optimizing, and scaling. Whether it's reducing inference latency, debugging training bottlenecks, or designing experimentation pipelines—I enjoy the grind.

Outside of work, I’m an **avid reader**, a **Kaggle and hackathon winner**, and a firm believer in open-source. I’ve contributed to various projects and created two Python packages: **`colab-everything`** and **`torchserve-python`**, both designed to simplify workflows and empower the ML community. Someday, I hope to share my journey and tools at a **Python Conference**.
