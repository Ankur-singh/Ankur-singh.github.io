# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}**,

A young entrepreneur with 4 years of experience in Artificial Intelligence and Python programming, also founder of a Machine Learning start-up, [Ai Adventures](https://www.aiadventures.in/){:target="_blank"}. Work experience in domains like Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Recommendation Systems and Predictive Modelling. Passionate about Machine Learning, Computer Science and Advance Mathematics.

I have also worked as a Team Lead (ML) at [Zoop.One](https://zoop.one/){:target="_blank"}. I helped develop various services like OCR Service, Document Scanner, Liveliness Service, etc. In the process of building these services, I build a phenomenal team of passionate ML Engineers. During my stint, I also improved the state of MLOps at Zoop.one by setting up best pactices, standarizing process, developing frameworks, etc. It was quite a learning experience.  

I spend most of my waking hours developing ML projects, reading & implementing research papers, contributing to open-source projects and participating in Kaggle Data Science competitions (by the time you reading it, I might have become a Kaggle Competition Expert). At other times you will find me reading books (mostly biographies) or exercising.
