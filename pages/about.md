# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}**,

Currently, I'm working as an AI Solutions Engineer at Intel. My part of my job, I had to migrate some CUDA samples to Intel's SYCL. This experience has ignited my passion for GPU programming. It has led me to explore tools like Triton and torch.compile, which make CUDA programming more accessible for Python developers, and has also sparked my interest in C++. Checkout my notes in [Today I Learned (TIL)](https://ankursinghmle.notion.site/c9ec2730e014406187628b59a15aadb3?v=191eb3f27860427688085d92960d4cf5) tab. 

I earned my Master's in Software Engineering from San Jose State University in May 2024. During my studies, I served as a research assistant under Dr. Wu and Dr. Liu at the SJSU Research Foundation. My research focused on Multi-Modal modeling, Federated Learning, Traffic Flow Prediction, and real-time edge deployment, providing me with hands-on experience in these cutting-edge areas.

With 4 years of prior professional experience in AI/ML, Software Engineering, DevOps, Cloud, and Databases, I embarked on my journey by founding [AI Adventures](https://www.aiadventures.in/){:target="_blank"}, a startup providing AI/ML solutions. Later, as an ML Team Lead at [Zoop.One](https://zoop.one/){:target="_blank"}, I orchestrated the successful launch of four ML services, housing 20+ deep learning models, handling over 2M+ requests/month. All this in just ten months. My approach, grounded in first principles, emphasized improving developer experience through process building, establishing best practices, and setting up efficient ML infrastructure, leading to rapid prototyping and significantly reduced Time To Market (TTM). I'm really proud of my work at Zoop.

Beyond my professional endeavors, I am an avid reader and actively participate in competitions, winning multiple Kaggle competitions and hackathons. I've contributed to several open-source projects and created two Python packages: colab-everything and torchserve-python, aiming to give back to the community. I aspire to give a talk at a Python Conference someday.
