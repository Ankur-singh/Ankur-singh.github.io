# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}**,

Currently, I am pursuing my Masters at San Jose State University. I am also working as a Student Research Assistant under Prof. KaiKai Liu. Some of the technologies that I am working with are Jetson, Docker, YOLOv7, Triton Inference Server, ROS2, Camera sensors, etc.

Before coming to US, I have was working as a Team Lead (ML) at [Zoop.One](https://zoop.one/){:target="_blank"}. I helped develop various ML services like OCR Service, Document Scanner, Liveliness Service, etc. In the process of building these services, I build a phenomenal team of passionate ML Engineers. During my stint, I also improved the state of MLOps at Zoop.one by setting up best pactices, standarizing process, developing frameworks/tools for data collection, training, evaluation, and model deployment. It was quite a learning experience.  

Before joining Zoop.One, I founded of a Machine Learning start-up, [Ai Adventures](https://www.aiadventures.in/){:target="_blank"}. At Ai Adventures, we provided AI/ML solutions to businesses. Furthermore, we provided Data Science training to students and professional. With our top-down teaching methodology, we not only helped several people to get started with Data Science but also do good in it professionally.

I spend most of my waking hours developing ML projects, reading & implementing research papers, contributing to open-source projects and participating in Kaggle Data Science competitions (by the time you reading it, I might have become a Kaggle Competition Master). At other times you will find me reading books (mostly biographies).
