Python is an amazing language to learn. It started as scripting language but now it is used for everything ranging from Web Development to Data Science and everything in-between. In this blog post we will learn to deploy a machine learning model using flask.

I have created a git [repo](#) with all the code that I will be using in this blog.

Lets get started, there are 3 primary things that we will be learning today.
- Flask basics
    - urls
    - templates
- Deploying Apps using flask
- Deploying ML models using flask

#### work in progress ...
