Current practitioners of Machine Learning will know about the difficulties associated in handling a ML project. Sometimes, it might appear daunting to an absolute beginner in the field (as a ML project has a lot of moving parts, all entangled together to make single model work). In this article, I have broken down ‘the complete process’ into small steps such that you can master them individually.

The complete article is inspired by Jeremy Howard’s [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) course. A huge shout out to [Jeremy](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward) and [Rachel](https://twitter.com/math_rachel) for their amazing course. I did the course, it was absolutely enlightening. Highly Recommended! With all this newly acquired knowledge, I had a strong urge to share it and I ended up writing this article.

I have also create kaggle kernels ([Part-1](https://www.kaggle.com/ankursingh12/lessons-learnt-from-fast-ai-lectures-part-1) and [Part-2](https://www.kaggle.com/ankursingh12/lessons-learnt-from-fast-ai-lectures-part-2)). It's crucial that you go through these, if you want to get a feel of how everything works in code.
